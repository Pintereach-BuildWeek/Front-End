### Organize You Studies

#### Summary
Pintereach is an app for managing articles for research. Users can add articles which appear on the home screen as cards. Each card contains a preview image rendered by Microlink, its title, summary, tags, a 'must read' button to add it to a 'must-read' list, and a delete button.

Axios is used to retrieve a list of articles rendered as cards. With the menu component, users can summon a modal to add an article, filter the view to display only specific categories, and a toggle button to display only articles marked as 'must read'.

Pintereach utilizes the following features, libraries, and components:

- Ant Design
- Axios
- Microlink
